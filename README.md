### Setting
In this practical session, you will code a method to compute the cost of shopping basket and test it using JUnit.
To do this, you will fill the cost method in the [BookShop](src/main/java/books/BookShop.java) class and test it.
The test have to be written in the [BookShopTest](src/test/java/books/BookShopTest.java) class and use Junit5. 

### Context
To try and encourage more sales of the first 5 different Harry
Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer 
discounts of multiple-book purchases. 

One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR. 

If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 7% 
discount on those two books.

If you buy 3 different books, you get a 14% discount. 

If you buy 4 different books, you get a 28% discount.

If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 35%
discount. 

Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are 
different titles, you get a 14% discount on the 3 that 
form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR. 

Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the 
price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only 
Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.
